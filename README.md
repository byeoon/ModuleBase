# ModuleBase
**ModuleBase** is an open source and free to use repository of code snippets used to make developing cheats for **Minecraft 1.8** easier. You can do whatever you want with this code; completely skid it (I don't condone that), build up from it, or use it as inspiration. This was made to give beginners a better understanding on how developing clients work. Implementing these into your client depends on how you set your base up and you may need to change certain things depending on the way your client works.

Lines of code will be commented along the way to better explain what certain thngs do.
